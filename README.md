Please open this file in a Jupyter Notebook. 

The sample FITS file is M51_HST (2).fits. Please put this in same jupyter folder as code. 

You are able to run code with any fits file and dynamically adjust scalings and vmin and vmax.

There are suggested scalings provided as well. You can save file as png. 

My project aims to create an interactive FITS downloadable Jupyter Notebook in which a user can upload their FITS file and is given suggestions on the ideal binning and scaling for a visual image. The user can then further adjust contrast with sliders and suggestions such as knowing the min and the max value of the image. 
The project will at least assess valuable fitting steps if it is a good image. I may make this an assumption at least for the first weeks of the project as I am going to try to rigorously assess the binning of the FITS file to provide the best options for the user. This, as a potential user, I would be most interested in. I do not know if Iâ€™ll have time to merge multiple images to a single image. I want to aim for assessing a single, good image well and see what else I have time for.
